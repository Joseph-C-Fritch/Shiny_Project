LIRR defines On-Time Performance using the following equation:


$$\huge OTP = (1 - \frac{n_{d} + n_{c} + n_{t}}{n_s})*100$$ 

Where,



\\$\huge n_{d}$ = Number of trains delayed

\\$\huge n_{c}$ = Number of trains cancelled

\\$\huge n_{t}$ = Number of trains terminated

\\$\LARGE n_{s}$ = Number of trains scheduled

<br />


Definitions:

Delayed: A train that arrives to its destination six minutes or more behind schedule.
(i.e. A train that arrives 5:59 after scheduled arrival is considered on-time.)

Cancelled: A train that never leaves its origin departure station.

Terminated: A train that leaves its origin departure station but never reaches its final destination.

Scheduled: A scheduled train as per published time tables for a specific time period.
