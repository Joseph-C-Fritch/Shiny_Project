Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) delays, cancellations and terminations lead to lost economic productivity 
and frustrated commuters.  This application visualizes
LIRR On-Time Performance (OTP) data with the intention of answering the following
questions: 

1. Which branches have the best/worst performance? 

2. Which month on average has the best/worst performance?

3. Has performance deteriorated over time?

4. What factors are associated with performance?

Data used for this visualization application can be found at: https://data.ny.gov/Transportation/Metropolitan-Transportation-Authority-MTA-Performa/cy9b-i9w9
